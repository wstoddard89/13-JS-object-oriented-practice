## Objectives

- Ability to understand the role Constructors play in JavaScript.
- Be able to create flexible functions that can serve a variety of data

## Normal Mode

1. You'll be ONLY adding code to the (`constructors`) area of the `constructors.js`, leave the rest of the code alone
2. Your goal is to make sure all of the tests pass
3. To see what that looks like, refer to the `final.png` inside the repo

## Deliverables

1. Push to github (origin/master)
2. Deploy to github pages
